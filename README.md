# The Sanitizing Shop (Backend)

This serves as the backend for The Sanitizing Shop. 

The corresponding frontend of the app, created using React.js, is deployed on Heroku at this URL:
https://the-sanitizing-shop.herokuapp.com/.

Its corresponding Github repo can be found here: https://github.com/michaelmamuric/the-sanitizing-shop

## Notes

The backend uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a popular NoSQL database. More specifically, data is stored in the cloud using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) was used to create the server endpoints, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) was used as the framework.

Together with the frontend coded with React, the entire project used the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).
